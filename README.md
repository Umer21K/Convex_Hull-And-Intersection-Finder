# Convex_Hull-And-Intersection-Finder
This is my project for Algorithm 

## Abstract
With mouse clicks, users will be able to interactively
add vertices and lines to a graphical canvas as part
of this project’s development of an intuitive application.
The system’s goal is to locate the sites where the
lines cross by employing a variety of algorithms, such
as bounding box, counter-clockwise, and determinant-
based techniques. Moreover, users can utilise the Andrew monotone,
Graham scan, Jarvis March, brute force,
and rapid elimination techniques to determine the convex hull
of the supplied collection of vertices. The
project offers users an easy-to-use interface for the analysis
and visualisation of geometric combinations.
Graham scan and Jarvice March have also been impleted with step by step updation seperately.

## Introduction
In many applications, including computational geometry
and computer graphics, geometric algorithms are
essential. The goal of this project is to develop an interactive
environment where users may investigate basic
point intersection and convex hull computing techniques
and interactively generate geometric forms. The
method makes it simple for users to add vertices and
lines to a graphical canvas, which makes it useful for
both practical and instructional reasons.
## The following are the project’s main goals:

1. Interactive Graphical Interface: Offer a user-friendly
setting where users may quickly enter geometric
configurations by clicking on vertices and lines.
Ans user can click button and their desired out-
come.

2. Point of Intersection: To locate points of inter-
section between the lines the user has inserted,
employ algorithms based on determinants, bound-
ing boxes, and counter-clockwise orientation.

3. Convex Hull Computation: By using and con-
trasting several convex hull algorithms, such as
Andrew monotone, Graham scan, Jarvis March,
brute force, and rapid elimination, users may as-
sess the effectiveness and performance of each
technique.

4. Graham scan and Jarvice March have also been impleted with step by step updation seperately.

## Software Environment
This was created on Python using libraries such as tk-
inter, math and time . Tkinter is used for the GUI interface.
Math is used for calculation and time is used
to output time in seconds.
